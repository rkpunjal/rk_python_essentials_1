# variable names cannot start with a number
# variable name cannot have a space, usually they use _
# variable names cannot be 'keywords'
# snake-case style of variable names is more common in python


# string can start with double-quotes or single-quotes

first_name = "Ram"
last_name = 'Punjal'

msg_1 = 'He said "Haha"'  # that is fine

msg_2 = "I can't find you"  # that is fine

# we can CHANGE type of a variable

age = 24  # it's an integer

age = "Twenty Four"  # now it's changed to string
